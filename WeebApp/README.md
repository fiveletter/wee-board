# WeebApp: Companion to Wee-board
The WeebApp is where the "Wee" in Wee-board comes from. The application not only connects and controls the Wee-Board, it also plays sound effects during your ride so you can show your Weeb Spirit!

# High Level Goals (Ordered by Priority)
- View for configuring board connection
- View for controlling the board
- Text area for diagnostic information about estimated Board speed and battery voltage
- Three speed buttons and one break button: Slow, Medium, Fast, Break
- Each button is associated with a sound effect

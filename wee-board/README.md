# Source & Build Details
This project is based off of the SJ One Board created by Preetpal Kang. Details on the SJ One board can be found at this [link](http://www.socialledge.com/sjsu/index.php?title=SJ_One_Board). There is a handy development package that includes all of the material needed to build this project, details can be found [here](http://www.socialledge.com/sjsu/index.php?title=MINGW_Development_Package(MAC_OS)). 

NOTE: Do not put the development package in a file path that includes spaces.
